### this too needs a full analog compared to cont.corrmax
  ## right now it's only a "reference" version

  ## if we want to do a correction for sample size in this case, all we need to do is scale up the sv/eigen values.

  ## I believe that the contributions (i.e., W^2) could actually be used by CA in some clever way. I just don't know it yet!
