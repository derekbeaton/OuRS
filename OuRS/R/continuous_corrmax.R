## this needs to be expanded / updated
## I need a plain corrmax and a reference corrmax (which is what this is)
## and I need to return more than just W^2


#cont.corrmax <- function(population.data,sample.data){
continous_corrmax <- function(target.data,rob.center=T,rob.scale=F,loadings,singular.values,tol=.Machine$double.eps){

  ## if we want to do a correction for sample size in this case, all we need to do is scale up the sv/eigen values.

  target.data <- ours_scale(target.data,center=rob.center,scale=rob.scale) #signs are switched; I can just *-1

  diag.sampcov <- sqrt(diag(tcrossprod( sweep(loadings,2,singular.values,"*") )))
  inv.DSD.half <- (tcrossprod(sweep( sweep(loadings,2,singular.values,"*"),1,diag.sampcov,"/") %^% (-1/2)))

  W <- target.data %*% sweep(inv.DSD.half,1,diag.sampcov,"/")
  #w.svd <- tolerance_svd(W,tol=tol)
    ## absolutely no need because, as in Eq 2(?) in Garthwaite & Koch (2016) they point out that X --> W exists where mahal(X) == mahal(W)


    ## we should use percentages in place of contributions as they have meaning
    ## also: we now have a new Mahalanobis from corrmax.
      ### WRONG: (not really) but this Mahal is the same as if it were done on the scaled data...
  #return(list(mah=rowSums(w.svd$u^2),percs=sweep(W^2,1,rowSums(W^2),"/")*100))
  return(sweep(W^2,1,rowSums(W^2),"/")*100)
    ## I believe that the contributions (i.e., W^2) could actually be used by CA in some clever way. I just don't know it yet!
